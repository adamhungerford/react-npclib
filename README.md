# react-npclib
A ReactJS-based gallery view of NPCs that you can host on GitHub Pages.

## Current status
Currently, `react-npclib` isn't yet at a minimum viable product. You can keep an eye on this repo in the meantime. 

## Why?
I ran out of space on Roll20 and thought it would be a good idea to help out other people who are a little code-savvy.

## How do I use this thing?
If you're serious about figuring out how this thing ticks before I work out an accessible interface, you can always fork the repository. If not, watch this space and I'll have something for you soon.

## What can I expect in the future?
I hope shortly to have an HTML file that'll let you set variables such as:
* Background colors
* Fonts
* Character details
    * Names
    * Pronouns
    * Descriptions
    * Portraits
